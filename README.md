how to run requirment.txt

I'll explain how to install dependencies from a requirements.txt file.
There are two main ways to install dependencies from a requirements.txt file using pip:
Basic Installation
txt
Using a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
txt
Using a virtual environment is recommended because:
It isolates your project dependencies from other Python projects
Prevents conflicts between different versions of packages
Makes it easier to manage project-specific dependencies
Keeps your global Python installation clean
After you're done working with the virtual environment, you can deactivate it:
deactivate
If you encounter any permission errors while installing packages, you might need to use:
txt
Note: Make sure you're in the same directory as your requirements.txt file when running these commands, or provide the full path to the requirements.txt file.
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement torch==2.1.0 (from versions: 2.2.0, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.0, 2.3.1, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.5.0, 2.5.1)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for torch==2.1.0

This error occurs because the specific version of PyTorch (2.1.0) specified in your requirements.txt is not available for your current Python version or system configuration.
Here's how to fix this:
Install the Latest Stable Version
You can modify the requirements.txt to use the latest stable version by removing the specific version constraint:
Or specify a newer version that's available:
Alternative Installation Method
If you prefer to install PyTorch directly, you can use the official PyTorch installation command from pytorch.org. First, remove torch and torchvision from requirements.txt, then install PyTorch separately:
cu118
Check Python Version
Make sure you're using a compatible Python version. Recent PyTorch versions might require Python 3.8 or newer. You can check your Python version with:
version
After installing PyTorch, you can proceed to install the remaining requirements:
txt
If you continue to have issues, please share your Python version and operating system for more specific guidance.

This error is occurring because you're trying to install NumPy 1.24.3 on Python 3.12, which isn't compatible. Let's modify the requirements.txt to use versions that are compatible with Python 3.12.
Here's the updated version:
The main changes are:
Updated NumPy to version 1.26.0 or higher, which supports Python 3.12
Changed fixed versions to minimum versions using >= to ensure compatibility
Try these alternative installation steps:
First, upgrade pip:
pip
Then install the requirements:
txt
If you still encounter issues, you could try installing NumPy separately first:
txt
Alternatively, you could:
Use an earlier version of Python (3.8-3.11) which has better compatibility with these packages
Or use conda instead of pip:
pytorch
Let me know if you need any clarification or run into other issues!

Ah, you're missing the required imports for PyTorch. Let me update the mnist_99_4.py file to include the necessary imports at the top:
The error occurred because the code was trying to use nn without importing it. The required imports are:
torch: The main PyTorch library

(base) arghyamukherjee@Arghyas-MacBook-Air assignment_6 %  there is no display

Ah, I see the issue. The current code only defines the model architecture but doesn't include any training or testing code. Let me help you create a complete script that loads the MNIST dataset, trains the model, and displays the results.
This updated version:
Loads the MNIST dataset
Trains the model for 10 epochs
Tests the model after each epoch
Displays a progress bar during training
Shows the test accuracy after each epoch
Creates a plot of accuracy over time
Saves the plot as 'accuracy_plot.png'
To run this:
Make sure you have all the required packages installed (from your requirements.txt)
Run the script: python mnist_99_4.py
You should see:
A progress bar showing training progress
Test accuracy after each epoch
A plot showing how accuracy improves over time
The script will create a new directory 'data' to store the MNIST dataset and save the accuracy plot as 'accuracy_plot.png' in your current directory.
Let me know if you need any clarification or run into issues!
display the number of [arameter and it should be less than 20 k

I'll modify the code to display the number of parameters and add a parameter count check. Here's the updated version:
Let's check the current parameter count. Based on your model architecture:
First conv block:
Conv2d(1→8): 8 (331 + 1) = 80
BatchNorm2d(8): 16
Conv2d(8→16): 16 (338 + 1) = 1,168
BatchNorm2d(16): 32
Second conv block:
Conv2d(16→16): 16 (3316 + 1) = 2,320
BatchNorm2d(16): 32
Conv2d(16→32): 32 (3316 + 1) = 4,640
BatchNorm2d(32): 64
Third conv block:
Conv2d(32→32): 32 (3332 + 1) = 9,248
BatchNorm2d(32): 64
Conv2d(32→10): 10 (3332 + 1) = 2,890
BatchNorm2d(10): 20
Total parameters: ~20,574
The current model slightly exceeds 20k parameters. Let me propose a modified version of the Model class to reduce the parameter count:
This modified architecture:
Reduces channels in the first block from 16 to 12
Adjusts the second block to use 24 channels instead of 32
Reduces the third block's intermediate channels
Should have approximately 19,000 parameters while maintaining good performance
When you run this modified version, it will display the parameter count at the start of training and ensure it's under 20k parameters. Let me know if you'd like to see the exact parameter count or if you need any adjustments!
have you implemenmted 99.4% validation/test accuracy (50/10k split, basically we are calling Validation dataset as test dataset itself)

Looking at your code and the goal of achieving 99.4% validation accuracy, we need to make a few modifications:
The current model architecture might need enhancement
We need to implement better training strategies
We should add learning rate scheduling
Here's the modified version:
Key improvements made to achieve 99.4% accuracy:
Data Augmentation:
Added RandomRotation
Added RandomAffine for translations
Training Strategy:
Implemented OneCycleLR scheduler
Increased epochs to 25
Increased batch size to 512
Added weight decay for better regularization
Model Architecture:
Optimized channel sizes
Added 1x1 convolution at the end
Reduced dropout to 0.05
Best Model Saving:
Saves the best performing model
Performance Monitoring:
Tracks and saves best accuracy
Shows training accuracy in progress bar
This implementation should be able to achieve 99.4% accuracy on the test set. The model will save the best weights to 'best_model.pth' when it achieves its highest accuracy.
Note: Due to the random nature of training, you might need to run it a few times to hit exactly 99.4%. The model should consistently achieve above 99.2% accuracy.
count number of pdatametrts also

I'll add a function to count and display the model parameters in detail. Here's the addition we need to make:
When you run this, it will display a detailed breakdown of parameters for each layer. The output will look something like this:
-
This will help you:
See exactly where your parameters are being used
Identify which layers are parameter-heavy
Verify that you're staying under the 20k parameter limit
Let me know if you'd like me to explain any specific part of the parameter counting or if you need help optimizing the model architecture further!

Looking at your output, we're getting close but not quite reaching 99.4% accuracy. The best accuracy shown is 99.35%. Let me suggest some modifications to push it to 99.4% while keeping parameters under 20k:
Key changes made:
Architecture modifications:
Adjusted channel progression (10→16→20→24)
Reduced dropout to 0.03
Optimized layer transitions
Training improvements:
Reduced batch size to 128 for better generalization
Adjusted learning rate to 0.05
Modified OneCycleLR schedule (pct_start=0.2)
Reduced weight decay to 1e-4
Enhanced augmentation:
Added scale augmentation (0.9-1.1)
Increased rotation range slightly (-8 to 8 degrees)
These changes should:
Keep parameters under 20k (you can verify with count_parameters())
Push accuracy to 99.4% within 20 epochs
Maintain stable training
The reduced batch size and enhanced augmentations should help with generalization, while the adjusted learning rate schedule should help reach higher accuracy faster.
Let me know if you'd like me to explain any of these changes in more detail or if you need further adjustments!
the code is working in local , replicate the same code without any changesin github.  YGitHub Actions file, so we can check:
Total paramter count <20,00 and test accuracy 99.4% within 20 epochs. use all the configuration changes so that it gives the same results for github actions

I'll help you create a GitHub Actions workflow file to run this exact code. We'll create a new file called mnist_test.yml in the .github/workflows directory:
And let's add a small modification to the main script to ensure deterministic behavior in the GitHub Actions environment:
This setup:
Environment Consistency:
Uses Python 3.10 which has good compatibility with PyTorch
Caches pip packages to speed up subsequent runs
Reproducibility:
Sets random seeds for consistent results
Disables CUDNN benchmarking for deterministic behavior
Validation:
Checks parameter count is under 20,000
Verifies accuracy reaches 99.4% within 20 epochs
Saves training log and accuracy plot as artifacts
Artifacts:
Uploads training logs and accuracy plot for inspection
To use this:
Create the .github/workflows directory in your repository:
workflows
Save the workflow file as mnist_test.yml in that directory
Add the seed setting code to your mnist_99_4.py
Push to GitHub:
push
The workflow will run automatically on every push and pull request, verifying that:
The model has less than 20,000 parameters
It achieves 99.4% accuracy within 20 epochs
Training completes successfully
You can view the results in the "Actions" tab of your GitHub repository, including the training log and accuracy plot.
Let me know if you need any adjustments to the workflow or have questions about any part of the setup!
create the mnist_test.yml file 

I see you want to create the mnist_test.yml file. First, you'll need to create the .github/workflows directory structure and then create the file inside it. Here are the commands to do this:
EOL
After running these commands, you should:
Commit the new file to your repository:
push
The workflow will automatically run when you push to GitHub. You can check the results in:
GitHub repository → Actions tab
The workflow will:
Run your MNIST training
Verify parameter count is under 20k
Check if accuracy reaches 99.4%
Save training logs and plots as artifacts
Let me know if you need any help with these steps or if you encounter any issues!
